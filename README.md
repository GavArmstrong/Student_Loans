# Student Loans

How is the existing balance of Federal Student Loans distributed accross different States in the US?

The Office of Federal Student Aid (https://studentaid.gov/data-center) provides data on the distribution of Federal Student Loans accross different geographic and demographic groups.
I pulled some of this data and created a choropleth from it.

# Student Loans

How is the existing balance of Federal Student Loans distributed across different States in the US?

The Office of Federal Student Aid (https://studentaid.gov/data-center) provides data on the distribution of Federal Student Loans for different geographic and demographic groups.

One such data file is Federal Student Loan Portfolio by Borrower Location (Portfolio-by-Location.xls)

```{r include=FALSE}
Loans <- list.files(pattern="Portfolio-by-Location") %>%
  read_excel(skip=5)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
head(Loans)
```

# Student Loans

How is the existing balance of Federal Student Loans distributed across different States in the US?

The Office of Federal Student Aid (https://studentaid.gov/data-center) provides data on the distribution of Federal Student Loans for different geographic and demographic groups.

One such data file is Federal Student Loan Portfolio by Borrower Location (Portfolio-by-Location.xls)

```{r include=FALSE}
Loans <- list.files(pattern="Portfolio-by-Location") %>%
  read_excel(skip=5)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
head(Loans)
```

This file provides the total Direct, Federal Family Education, and Perkins open loan amounts owed by borrowers, as well as the total number of borrowers across each State.

From this data we can calculate the Average Federal Student Loan amount, in an open status, owed by borrowers in each state:

```{r include=FALSE}
names(Loans) %<>% make.names(unique=TRUE)

Loans %<>% select(State = Location,
                  Debt = Balance..in.billions.,
                  Borrower_Count = Borrowers..in.thousands.) %>%
  mutate(State = str_to_title(State),
         `Average Debt per Person` = Borrower_Count*1000/Debt) %>%
  select(-Debt, -Borrower_Count)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
head(Loans)
```

We want to present this data in a concise way. One way to achieve this is using a choropleth (map disp).

There are many different packages capable of creating choropleths in R.

In this case we want to display the mainland States of the USA. The "map"-function from the "maps" package is sufficient for our purposes.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(maps)
library(sf)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
USA <- st_as_sf(maps::map("usa", plot=FALSE, fill=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ID = str_to_title(ID))
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
States <- st_as_sf(maps::map("state", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ID = str_to_title(ID)) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(State = ID)
```

We can now join the loan tibble to our simple-features map multigons:

```{r eval=FALSE}
States %<>% left_join(Loans)
```

Finally, we can use ggplot2 to create our choropleth:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(USA) +
  geom_sf(fill = "antiquewhite1",
          lwd=0,
          color="black") +
  geom_sf(data=States,
          aes(geometry=geom,
              fill=`Average Debt per Person`),
          lwd=0.2,
          color="#002240") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#61ff5e",
                      high = "#ea1730",
                      labels=list("$24,000", "$26,000", "$28,000",
                                  "$30,000", "$32,000", "$34,000")) +
  ggtitle("Average Federal Student Loan Debt by State (April, 2020)",
          subtitle = bquote(bold("Source:") ~"https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio")) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#002240"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#002240"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "white",
                                   family="Arial",
                                   size=7),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.55,"cm"),
        legend.justification=c(1,0), 
        legend.position=c(0.95, 0.05),  
        legend.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(color="white",
                                  family="Arial Rounded MT Bold",
                                  size=12),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color="white",
                                     family="Arial",
                                     size=7))
```

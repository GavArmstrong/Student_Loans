# Student Loans

How is the existing balance of Federal Student Loans distributed across different States in the US?

The Office of Federal Student Aid (https://studentaid.gov/data-center) provides data on the distribution of Federal Student Loans across different geographic and demographic groups.
I have pulled some of this data and considered different ways to present the information contained within.

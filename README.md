Student Loans
=============

How is the existing balance of Federal Student Loans distributed across
different States in the US?

The Office of Federal Student Aid
(<a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center" class="uri">https://studentaid.gov/data-center</a>)
provides data on the distribution of Federal Student Loans for different
geographic and demographic groups.

One such data file is Federal Student Loan Portfolio by Borrower
